# Meteor TO-DO App

It a basic simple app for learning the basic concepts of meteor. 
I would really like to thank the meteor commuunity for creating such a awesome documentation for meteor.


# Initial folder structure

To create a meteor project run : `meteor create <project name>` 
This will create a new directory by name `<project name>` 
Initially the repo will contain files :-

```
client/main.js        # a JavaScript entry point loaded on the client
client/main.html      # an HTML file that defines view templates
client/main.css       # a CSS file to define your app's styles
server/main.js        # a JavaScript entry point loaded on the server
test/main.js          # a JavaScript entry point when running tests
package.json          # a control file for installing npm packages
package-lock.json     # describes the npm dependency tree
node_modules/         # packages installed by npm
.meteor/              # internal Meteor files
.gitignore            # a control file for git
```
